## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I changed the entry for membership price by giving them present choices instead of making them to enter each numbers. It gives user a limited choices and it will only collect required and reasonable values.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I changed the background to plain white background rather than the one with lines. Those lines could confuse users and the site would look unprofessional. It might be more legible with plain white background with black font color.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I would like to change the menu button color to blue. I also changed the dropdown membership list too. And the arrow would be blue too.
