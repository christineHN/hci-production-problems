## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/113-design-guidelines-homepage-usability/
2. https://drpete.co/?topic=25-point-website-usability-checklist

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Adequate Text-to-Background Contrast : lists of menu should be visible
2. Avoid single-item categories and single-item bulleted lists : menu under each categories are more than one
3. Don't use generic instructions, such as "Click Here" as a link name : describe what the buttons are really for
4. Begin the window title with the information-carrying word : company name should be at the top for the whole time
5. Images Have Appropriate ALT Tags : logo should have ALT tags
6. Site Has Custom Not-found/404 Page : I think we should have this just in case the site goes down
7. Clear Path to Contact Information : make contact information more visible
8. Main Navigation Is Easily Identifiable : nav bar are always on the top
9. Styles & Colors Are Consistent : maybe the buttons should have consistent colors
10. HTML Page Titles Are Explanatory : company name
