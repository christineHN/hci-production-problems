1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=13K0u0keaqE5tNl8LBGiWjWm+fU
Your Rationale: I chose grayish blue since blue is the color that represent calm, cold, corporate, and masculine. The games that are about future and science are getting popular and blue and grey seems like they are they color of future especially for science fiction games.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=50D0u0kiMtK8SMMe9AVmJpXqqlm
Your Rationale: Green usually represents nature but I think topaz and indian red are more like springtime colors which could represents different types of flowers.  

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=74l1f0kFfM0jiCfoxwEwboHCFj6
Your Rationale: Kids often lack in concentration and those bright colors are really catchy. Also those blue, green, red and yellow are the basic colors so it might help kids to distinguish each alphabets.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c4z5B0g3y0kgYqOjiCffet-mdphkokR
Your Rationale: Those colors include colors that are commonly used in text editors. If I had more choices, I would add silver or gray since those colors are often used in security services.
